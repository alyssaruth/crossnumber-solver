/**
 * For clues like:
 *
 *  - The sum of this numberâ€™s digits is one less than 6D
 *  - The remainder when this number to the power of 91 is divided by 18,793,739 is 12A
 *
 *  Can be equivalently achieved by writing:
 *
 *     calculationWithReference(other) { value, other -> mapper(value) == other }
 *
 *  However, this is more verbose and less efficient to run, as it will do n*m calculations
